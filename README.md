# Powershell-Default-ps1
Sets .ps1 files to open in PowerShell instead of Notepad without running any third-party crap.

To download, press the GREEN "Code" button, NOT IN THE RELEASES TAB, at the top of this page and press "Download Zip." Extract the archive and run the script AS ADMINISTRATOR.

After the script completed, double-click the ps1 file and it should pull up the "Open With" window. Choose Powershell and Click "Always."
